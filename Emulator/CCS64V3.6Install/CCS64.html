<h2>Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to the world of CCS64. This a software emulator of the Commodore 64 computer.
  You may say this is not the first program trying to emulate the C64. But this is planned
  to be the finale C64 emulator. I have worked in several years with this product, studying
  the C64 into its innermost secrets. This shareware version should run perfectly with all
  games or demos, even those using the 1541 disk drive.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <li>True tape emulation including turbotape and tape images (use originals on tape). Sorry
      but for the true tape images, it is a little hard to create them, as I use special
      hardware and program on my AMIGA computer, see the <a
      href="http://www.computerbrains.com/ccs64">CCS64 Homepage</a>. But there are programs
      available for PC developed by other people, that could use a commercial PC to C2N
      connector or an high-quality audio sampling.</li>
    <li>Pause mode, where you could single-step screen frames and look at interlaced pictures.</li>
    <li>Freeze function, to save or restore the status of the emulator. This feature is under
      development so use with care...</li>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Starting</h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <h4>WIN32 version:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>To start the program just run the file named CCS.EXE.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Using</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>To do anything meaningful you should enter the program menu by pressing the key F9.<br>
    <br>
    To use PC joysticks you have to calibrate them first. Calibration is selected from the
    submenu Options/Input in the menu.<br>
    <br>
    If you have any problems with the settings and want the factory default settings back,
    just delete the 'C64.CFG' configuration file and it will be restored next time you run
    CCS64.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Menu</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>To use the Menu press F9 and then use the cursor keys to select. Use cursor right or
    enter to enter a choice. Use escape to go back to the previous menu from a submenu. Use
    cursor up or down to change selection. Use cursor left or right to change a value. Where
    specified you could also use the functions keys. When a selection can by applied, enter
    can also be used.<br>
    <br>
    In a directory listing you could also use PageUp or PageDown to scroll faster through the
    selections. To get directly to the first filename which starts with a specific letter, you
    could press CTRL+letter. </p>
    <p>In some menus you could also select an option by pressing the first letter in the
    option name, like S for the option &quot;Select disk&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Keyboard</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The keyboard is emulated almost like a real C64 keyboard and follows the C64 keyboard
    layout, except for these keys:</p>

  <h3>Multi-Play Over Internet</h3>
  <blockquote>
  <p>From the main menu, enter the submenu of Device 1 or 8-11. Enter the directory that contains
  the .T64/.D64/.PRG files that you want to be able to use for multi-play over Internet. Use cursor
  up/down keys to position on the &quot;.&quot; directory, then press F3. Using the Kaillera client
  you can now connect to a server and from there either create a new game or join an existing one.
  Remember to not start your created game until enough people have joined. If you join an existing
  game, the game will start as soon as the game creator has started. To be able to join an existing
  game, you have to have started the multi-play menu from a directory which contains exactly the
  same file as the one that the game creator has.</p>
  <p>During the Multiplay session, no menu setting can be reached. Therefore, remember to set correct
  settings for input devices etcetera before entering the multi-play menu. The multi-play session is
  ended by pressing either F9 or the F10 keys.</p>

  <h3>Tape Device Noise - Raw-Tape (TAP) Files</h3>
  <blockquote>
  <p>You can listen to the tape drive noise that would be generated whilst loading
  raw-tape (TAP) files. This can be fun or just help pass the time away! Simply 
  perform the following steps:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the SID volume to the maximum.  Type POKE 54296,15.</li>
    <li>Issue the BASIC LOAD command.  Type LOAD.</li>
    <li>Select the desired raw-tape (TAP) file.</li> 
  </ul>

  <h3>Additional Windows/Graphical Enhancements</h3>
  <blockquote>
  <p>The following additional enhancements have been made that take advantage specifically
     of the Windows/DirectX environment/functionality and other graphical techniques:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>The ability to select a custom re-fresh rate for graphics.  This depends upon the
    support for this in your graphics card/driver.</li>
    <li>The ability to rotate the graphics through 90, 180, or 270 degrees.</li>
    <li>Various graphical filters - Scale (based upon Scale2x), Scan-Lines, and Anti-Alias.
    These work in all graphical resolutions.</li>
    <li>Drag-and-drop support for program files, which automatically performs a default load/run
    of the image file dragged-and-dropped.  Only works in windowed mode.</li>
    <li>For any valid Commodore 64 file format that is associated with CCS64 in the Windows Registry,
    double-clicking on that Commodore 64 format file will automatically start it within CCS64.

    the monitor is native it doesn't affect the current emulated program in any way, all

  <h3>Common Problems</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Some times special games on .D64 images will behave badly when you use the 'Run (Fast)' or
    'Boot (Fast)' feature (this is default). To solve this problems do like this, use the
    'Run (Normal)' or 'Boot (Normal)' features instead; otherwise, perform the following:<br>
    1) Reset the C64. <br>
    2) Enter menu (1541 Device 8) and select the correct .D64 (Insert Disk)<br>
    3) From the BASIC type:<br>
    LOAD&quot;*&quot;,8,1<br>
    <br>
    If you do not have a CD-ROM in your CD-drive or a disk in your disk drive, the emulator
    will hang up if you select this device in the menu. So please, always be sure that you
    have an initialized (sometimes you have to wait some seconds after instering it) CD-ROM in
    your CD-drive before trying to use the CD device from the menu.<br>
    <br>
    The option load as Turbo tape should only be used when you get a message like &quot;PRESS
    PLAY ON TAPE&quot; on your C64-screen, and you're sure about that the second part should
    be loaded as turbo tape. Otherwise nothing useful will happen.<br>
    <br>
    Note that when your sampling the C64's audio output to a .WAV file, the sample rate and
    bit resolution will be the same as selected in the C64.CFG file.<br>
    <br>
    Note that on a German keyboard, the keys Y and Z will have changed place when using under
    CCS64.<br>
    <br>
    When you use the Screen-Shot function, the image will be saved as CCS0.BMP, CCS1.BMP, 
    CCS2.BMP, and so on.<br>
    <br>
    When you use the Sound Sampling function, the audio file will be saved as CCS0.WAV, CCS1.WAV,
    CCS2.WAV, and so on.<br>
    <br>
    When you use the printer emulation, the output will be saved as PRINTER4.TXT, PRINTER5.TXT,
    and so on.<br>
    <br>
    When you use the HardSID support, the "Channels 1-4 Burst" and "Channels 1-4 Buffered" modes
    are recommended for faster CPUs; the "Channels 1-3 Burst & Channel 4 Emulated" mode is
    recommended for slower CPUs.<br>
    <br>
    If you have some problems with the configuration of CCS64, and want to go back to the
    default settings, just delete the C64.CFG file from the CCS64 installation directory.<br>
    <br>
    Using the emulator under Windows with old and out-dated sound drivers can sometimes cause
    the system to hang or for there to be no sound at all.</p>
